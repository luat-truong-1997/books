# Introduction
## What and Why is DBMS?
DBMS are ued to manage colelctions of data that:
- High valuable
- Relative large
- Accesses by multiple stakeholders

2 main models:
- OLTP (online transaction processing): Main goal is support a large amount of users when each of them will process on a relative small of data
- OLAP (data analytics): Working on a large amount of data at once

## Why don't use file system directly?
- Data redundancy and inconsistency
- Access and query data problem
- Data isolation
- Data intergrity is not ensured
- Atomicity problems
- Concurrent-access problem
- Data authority problem

## Data models

Data model is conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and data constrainnts

4 different categories of data models:
- Relational model: data and relationships among them are represent by tables. Also known as record-based model.
- Entity-relationship model: Collection of entities and relationship.
- Semi-structured Data Model: The semi-structured data model permits the specifi-
cation of data where individual data items of the same type may have different sets of attributes
- Object-based data model: Database systems allow procedures to be stored in the database system and executed by the database system. This can be seen as extending the relational model with notions of encapsulation, methods, and object identity.
